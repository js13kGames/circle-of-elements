circle-of-elements
==================

My project for the js13kGames competition. It is my first game written without an engine so it is not coded perfectly. And even if it wonÂ´t have any chances against the strong competitors, I had fun creating this project. Hope you like it and sorry for the bad comments, I am German native speaker.

Play the game here: http://games.blamberg.org/circle_of_elements/rules.html

I have no idea how to upload images, sorry! You can find them on my website if you need them: http://games.blamberg.org/circle_of_elements/src/
